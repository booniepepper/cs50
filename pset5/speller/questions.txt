0.  an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.
1.  returns resource usage measurements
2.  16 members - two of those are other structs
3.  i'm not 100% sure, but i think a struct in reality is just a set of pointers to its child variables, so passing by reference means we can dereference its child variables
4.  the for loop iterates on every character in the loaded file one-by-one. it builds words by filling in the "word" char array from the beginning for each alphabet or apostrophe character. if a word starts with an apostrophe or contains a number, it's ignored and we continue on. otherwise, we finish the word by putting a null terminator '\0' in it to signify that's the end of the word for anything that will use it, increments the word count, and then checks for a misspelling.
5.  fgetc() only requires you to allocate space for a single character per read. if you were reading entire strings, you'd be getting lines of text (e.g. separated by newline, so a whole paragraph = 1 line) and have to worry about allocating/freeing memory each time, as well as handling splitting that out into the individual words and iterating on those
6.  changing the dictionary or word being checked inside one of these methods would defeat the purpose - they need to be "constant" within the scope of those methods
