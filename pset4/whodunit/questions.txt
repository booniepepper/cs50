1.  stdint.h is a library of cross-platform integer types that allows you to specify details like number of bits or performance
2.  the point is to get/set a specific size (in bytes) of a signed/unsigned integer. this is especially useful when you know in a file how a specific value will be stored
3.  BYTE: 1 byte, DWORD: 4 bytes, LONG: 4 bytes, WORD: 2 bytes
4.  The first two bytes need to be the ascii characters "BM" (424d0a in hex)
5.  bfSize is the size of the whole file, biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure
6.  if biHeight is negative, the bitmap definition starts in the top left
7.  biBitCount defines the bits-per-pixel
8.  fopen could return NULL if the read file doesn't exist, or if the user executing the script doesn't have permission to read/write the respective read/write file
9.  we want to read the headers once each. the 1 is being passed as an argument which specifies "x many chunks"
10. padding should equal 3 (bytes)
11. fseek allows you to put the pointer in a file at any position (i.e. for reading in an order that isn't first-to-last, or skipping sections)
12. SEEK_CUR is the "seek cursor" which is the place in the file you're currently reading from already
